branching is used to work in different contexts on same repository.Suppose we as a team of developers are developing a website.A developer
A is working on improving the UI feature of the website.Another developer B is working on bugfix feature.It would get messy if both developers work
on the same copy of the directory.Thats where the use of branching comes in.So,basically branching is used to work on the different copies of the same
directory.Also it would help us in maintaining fair copy of the directory(in which only satisfactory work is saved) using the master branch
In order to merge a branch into another use the following steps:
make sure that you are on the branch you want to merge changes into
then run the command git merge <name of the branch you want to merge>
